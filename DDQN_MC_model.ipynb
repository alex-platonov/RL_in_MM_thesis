    "# The MC Model\n",

    "The Markov chain (MC) model is the second model used in this thesis. It is significantly more complex than the simple probabilistic model, however, it is still quite rudimentary in comparison with real-life markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, the limit order book (LOB) is modelled explicitly. There are six event types:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Buy limit orders \n",
    "> 2. Sell limit orders\n",
    "> 3. Cancel buy orders\n",
    "> 4. Cancel sell orders\n",
    "> 5. Buy market orders\n",
    "> 6. Sell market orders\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrival of an order triggers a state transition in the Markov chain. An illustration of how different order arrivals modify the limit order book is provided in the figure below.\n",

    "> * The market maker has to quote bid and ask prices every second.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * The market maker can put the bid and ask depths at *max\\_quote\\_depth* different levels, from _1_ to *max\\_quote\\_depth* ticks away from the best ask and best bid price respectively.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * The cash process _X<sub>t</sub>_ denotes the market makers cash at time _t_.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * The inventory process _Q<sub>t</sub>_ denotes the market makers inventory at time _t_.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * The value process _V<sub>t</sub>_ denotes the value of the market maker's position at time _t_, that is its cash plus the value of its current inventory.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * The market maker can see the current time _t_ , its inventory _Q<sub>t</sub>_, the spread and the *full LOB* before taking an action.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * At time _t = T_ the market maker is forced to liquidate its position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _tick_ is the smallest tradeable unit of the underlying, for instance $0.01 of 1AAPL.\n",

    "Contrary to the SPM, it is not possible to derive an analytically optimal strategy in the MC model."
